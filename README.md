Feeding Dan in 2015 ([feeding.schlosser.io](https://feeding.schlosser.io))
====================================================================

In 2015, I took a picture of everything I ate.  These are those photos.

I built a custom image loading system I fondy call `pig.js`.  [Check out that libary here](https://github.com/schlosser/feeding-dan/blob/master/src/js/pig.js).  Does that stand for Progressive Image Grid?  Maybe.  Does it just mean Pig?  Maybe. 

Dan Eats is built using [Gulp][gulp], [Handlebars.js][handlebars], and [SCSS][scss].

## Setup

Install [npm][npm-install]. Then, install gulp:

```
npm install -g gulp  # May require `sudo`
```

## Developing

```
npm install
gem install scss_lint
gulp serve
```

## Gulp

An overview of Gulp commands available:

### `gulp build`

Builds the site into the `dist` directory.  This includes:

- SCSS w/ linting, sourcemaps and autoprefixing
- JS linting and uglification
- Handlebars to HTML

### `gulp build:optimized`

This is used for distributing an optimized version of the site (for deployment).  It includes everything from `gulp build` as well as:
- SCSS minification
- CSS / JS inline-sourcing 

### `gulp watch`

Watchs for changes in local files and rebuilds parts of the site as necessary, into the `dist` directory.

### `gulp serve`

Runs `gulp watch` in the background, and serves the `dist` directory at `localhost:3000` with automatic reloading using [Browsersync][browsersync].

### `gulp deploy`

For use by Dan only.  Deploys to `feeding.schlosser.io`, but won't do so without proper authentication.
